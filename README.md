# lient-server-based-smart-chatting-box-application-
The java chat application we have design is a console application that is launched from the command line. The server and clients can run on different computers in the same network, e.g. Local area network (LAN).
Multiple clients connected to one server can chat and see otherâ€™s messages.
After getting connected, a user must provide his or her name to enter the chat. The server sends a list of currently online users to the new user.
Every user is notified when a new user arrives and when a user has gone. Each message is prefixed with the username to keep track who sent the message.
